# Finding Information
This repository holds the slides for a course on information literacy, taught at the [Vrije Universiteit](https://www.vu.nl/) in 2022. Slides were made in `R` using the [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package, which is an `RMarkdown` extension on the [`remark.js`](https://remarkjs.com/) library.
